Advanced User Audit Log and Login History
======================

Overview
--------
Advanced User Audit Log and Login History is an Odoo 18 module that helps administrators monitor user access, login sessions, failed login attempts, logout history, user activity logs, model-wise audit logs, browser details, device information, IP address, and location tracking.

This module improves Odoo security visibility by recording every user session with useful audit details such as login time, logout time, session duration, browser, operating system, IP address, country, city, latitude, longitude, and map location.
