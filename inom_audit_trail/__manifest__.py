    "description": """Audit Trail for Odoo - track who changed what, when and from where.

The complete audit log / activity tracking solution for Odoo. Create rule-based
logging on ANY object (model) and record Create, Read, Update and Delete
operations. For updates, capture full field-level history with the exact old
value and new value, the user who made the change, their IP address and browser,
and an optional GeoIP location. A live dashboard shows active users right now,
today's activity versus yesterday, and your active rules.

Key features:
* Rule-based tracking per Odoo object / model (res.partner, sale.order, account.move, and any custom model)
* Log Create / Read / Update / Delete operations
* Field-level change history: old value to new value for the fields you choose
* Restrict logging to specific user groups
* Capture user IP address, browser / OS, and (optional) GeoIP location
* Live audit dashboard: active users now, activity today vs yesterday, active rules
* Searchable, filterable, groupable audit log
* Works with custom modules out of the box - no per-model coding required

Great for compliance, data security and accountability: GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, ISO 27001.

Compatible with Odoo 17, 18 and 19 - Community and Enterprise.
